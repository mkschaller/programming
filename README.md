# Programming Resources for McHenry County College's Courses
The CIS and Digital Media Department at McHenry County College's programming resources page. This website is linked to on the learning management system the college uses, Canvas, for students to reference.

## JavaScript
This page links to [Meri Engel's](https://github.com/meriengel) prg147 homepage includes video references created specifically for the class.

## Python Resources
The Python resources page is organized into modules \(accordions\) the same way the PRG105 class is. While these videos are not required for students to view, this resource can be used in addition to the textbook to aid in learning. Resources vary from Lynda.com videos to YouTube videos to online references.
